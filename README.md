# VAT_CharacterBlueprint
 

The contents of this repository is part of my Bachelor's Thesis for SAE Institute and Middlesex University, Department Visual Effects & Animation. 
It contains an Unreal Engine 5.1 project file and all the produced practical components as described within my major project written assignment. 

- VAT Material Asset and its instance
- VATBP
- SKBP
- Array spawning blueprint
- Navigation blueprints (spline BP and destination BP)
- Other supportive files and assets (animations, textures, etc)

These assets will only work properly if accessed through this project file, but its contents can be migrated to a new Unreal Engine 5.1 project from within the software, with several requirements:
- UE 5.1's 'Third Person Character' content package is in the new project.
- virtual texture support must be enabled in project settings.

Barring internal conflict with other existing files within the project, the blueprints should perform as intended.
